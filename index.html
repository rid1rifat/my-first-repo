        <strong>author: Unknown </strong>
        <p>This famous historic place is situated on the northeast side of Dhaka, Bangladesh. This was built during the Mughal rule, on seventeenth century.

            Lalbagh fort is believed to be an incomplete Mughal fort structure which was started in 1678 AD by the Mughal Subahdar Muhammad Azam Shah. As the structure applies to the fine architectural work of that period, it has four main structures which are a Diwan-i-Aam, a water tank in its eastern side, the tomb of Bibi Pari and the Lalbagh Fort Mosque. During the nineteenth century, this fort grew up to be a place of revolution by the local soldiers, against the colonial British rule.
            
            The best time to visit this place is November to March, a little wintery environment, paints colors to the fort and its lush green garden.</p>
